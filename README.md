## Hi there 👋
🎓 This is Yibo. I just finished my PhD at School of Pharmacy Univercity College London in April 2024 in bioinformatics. I am now working as a post-doc research associate at UCL on a short project funded by The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, with my PhD supervisor Dr. Claudia Manzoni. The project ends in March 2025. I am looking for post-doc positions and bioinformatician roles in the industry.

👩‍🏫 About my research: 
I am a bioinformatician with a strong interest in systems biology research involving large-scale multi-omics datasets, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. My PhD and post-doctoral research focuses on understanding the expression and interaction patterns of Parkinson's disease (PD)-related genes across different tissues and brain regions.

As a first author, I have published papers that provide valuable insights into the tissue-specificity of PD-gene interaction networks. One of my key findings demonstrated how transcriptomics of PD-gene interactors can distinguish between familial and sporadic forms of PD, revealing that these two forms of the disease have distinct pathologies despite presenting similar symptoms. This discovery is crucial for advancing drug development and improving the design of clinical trials, as it underscores the need for targeted therapeutic approaches for different PD subtypes. I have also contributed to several collaborative projects, providing statistical analysis and pathway modeling support to wet-lab researchers. These contributions have facilitated a deeper understanding of complex biological processes and have driven forward translational research efforts.

In the last two decades, the advent of high-throughput screening and sequencing techniques has greatly enriched multi-omics data repositories. Therefore, I am now interested in applying my skills in multi-omics analysis in a broader context. I am eager to contribute to projects that aim to construct multi-domain modeles utilising multi-omics data through deep learning algorithms. By integrating multi-omics characteristics, these models can generate an accurate, real-time "fingerprint" for individual health status. This multi-omics "fingerprint" can be applied in disease risk assessment, early disgnosis, personalised healthcare and precise medicine. In addition, these models can also be devloped into exploratory tools for understanding disease mechanisms and identifying drug targets.

🔬 Key Areas of Expertise:
  - Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Analysis
  - Multi-Omics Data Integration
  - Molecular Interaction Network Analysis
  - Machine Learning Models on Disease Classification & Prediction

💻 Skills:
  - R: Proficient in using R for omics analysis, with enriched experience in packages like "deseq2", "wgcna" and "limma"
  - Python: Skilled in Pythn for machine learning, using libraries such as 'scikit-learn'
  - PLINK: Experienced with PLINK for genomics data analysis and managing large-scale genotype data
  - HPC: Experienced in utilizing HPC environments for large-scale data processing and machine learning model training
